# Project-Based-Learning
A collection of the small projects I work on everyday to learn new concepts and practice my programming skills!

Zero_Insertion: A MATLAB function which insterts 'm' zeroes after every 'M'th element of a given vector 'x' to make a new row vector 'y'.

Physical State Calculator: A Python program which tells you the physical state of an object given its current temperature.

Max_Element_Finder: A MATLAB script which locates the element with the highest value in a matrix and returns its position.

Naive_Gauss: A MATLAB function which performs naive gaussian elimination on a given matrix.

RPS: A Java Rock-Paper-Scissors applet.

Five RPG: A Java RPG which incorporates several minigames and uses ASCII art.

Newtown_Raphson_Method: A program which finds a root of a given function (-0.9 x^2+ 1.7 x + 2, in this case) using the Newton-Raphson Method. In this case, x0 = 5 and the computation is performed until the tolerance is less than 0.01%.
